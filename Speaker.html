            <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>

            <p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217;t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217;t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217;s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it&#8217;s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>

            <p>In Aaron's session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don't, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace's culture. Once you've worked within a culture of design its almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

            <h5>What Disney Can Teach You about User Experience Design</h5>

            <p>From the creation of the 1937 film <cite>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</cite>, to newer animated films such as <cite>The Princess and the Frog</cite>, to the branded &#8220;Wonderful World of Disney&#8221; itself, the Disney empire has been built upon a design ecosystem. Each film, theme park, or cruise shares a holistic view of a perfect world across time and cultures. Within each experience, the same beloved character traits are highlighted, similar visual and animation styles are used, and the same story and musical techniques are leveraged to bring the audience to an emotional place. This helps make the user experience familiar and nostalgic, and lightens the audience&#8217;s cognitive load to promote enjoyment. Join Erica as she highlights Disney&#8217;s user experience techniques and outlines how you can use them to design an ecosystem that will leave behind a lasting legacy, even while waiting in an extremely long line.</p>
